# Docker Monitor Configuration
#
# This file can be placed in one of the following locations (in priority order):
# 1. ./config.yaml, ./config.yml, ./.dtop.yaml, or ./.dtop.yml (relative to current directory)
# 2. ~/.config/dtop/config.yaml or ~/.config/dtop/config.yml
# 3. ~/.dtop.yaml or ~/.dtop.yml
#
# Command line arguments take precedence over config file values.

# Docker host(s) to connect to
# You can specify multiple hosts to monitor them simultaneously

hosts:
  # Basic host without additional fields
  - host: local

  # Host with optional Dozzle URL
  # - host: ssh://root@146.190.3.114
  #   dozzle: https://l.dozzle.dev/

  # Host with filters (only show running containers named nginx)
  # - host: local
  #   filter:
  #     - status=running
  #     - name=nginx

  # Host with label filters (production environment only)
  # - host: ssh://user@server1
  #   dozzle: https://dozzle.server1.com/
  #   filter:
  #     - label=environment=production
  #     - status=running

  # More examples:
  # - host: ssh://user@server2:2222
  #   dozzle: https://dozzle.server2.com/
  #   filter:
  #     - ancestor=ubuntu:24.04  # Only containers from Ubuntu 24.04 image
  # - host: tcp://192.168.1.100:2375  # TCP connection (unencrypted)
  #   filter:
  #     - health=healthy  # Only healthy containers
  # - host: tls://192.168.1.100:2376  # TLS connection (encrypted, requires DOCKER_CERT_PATH)
  #   filter:
  #     - network=bridge  # Only containers on bridge network
# Icon style for the UI
# Options: "unicode" (default, works everywhere) or "nerd" (requires Nerd Font)
# icons: unicode
# icons: nerd

# Show all containers (default: false, shows only running containers)
# Set to true to show all containers including stopped, exited, and paused containers
# This is equivalent to using the --all/-a flag or pressing 'a' in the UI
# all: false
# all: true
